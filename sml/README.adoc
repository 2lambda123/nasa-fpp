This directory contains a reference implementation of FPP in Standard ML.

== Requirements

To build the implementation, you need the following:

* https://github.com/bocchino/redo[redo]

* https://www.smlnj.org[Standard ML of New Jersey (SML/NJ)]

You must set the environment variable `SMLNJ_HOME` to the home directory of 
your SML/NJ installation. It should contain a directory `bin` with a directory 
`.run` inside it.

== Building the Tools

Run `redo` in this directory. That will create a directory `bin` with the
executable tools inside it.

== Running the Tests

Run `redo tests/all` to run the tests.
