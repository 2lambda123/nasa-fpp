= Compiler

*Requirements:*
Install the 
https://www.scala-sbt.org[Simple Build Tool (sbt)] for Scala.

*Installing:*
To install in the `bin` directory, run `./install`.
To install to a different directory, run `./install` _dir-name_.

The currently available tools are

* `fpp-syntax`

See https://github.jpl.nasa.gov/bocchino/fpp/wiki/Tools
for more information.

*Development:*

. Start up the sbt shell.

. In the shell, run `compile` to compile everything, `test` to run all unit tests,
and `assembly` to create jar files.
The installer script runs these commands automatically.
It also moves the jar files to the install directory and puts executable
shell scripts there.
