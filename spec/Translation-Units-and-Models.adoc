== Translation Units and Models

=== Translation Units

A *translation unit* forms part of a <<Models,model>>
at the top level.

==== Syntax

A translation unit is an
<<Element-Sequences,element sequence>> in which each 
element is any kind of
<<Definitions,definition>>
except an enumerated constant definition,
and the terminating punctuation is a semicolon.
Syntactically, it is identical to a
<<Definitions_Module-Definitions_Syntax,module member 
sequence>>.

==== Example

Here is a translation unit:

[source,fpp]
----
module M1 { constant a = 0 }
----

And here is another one:

[source,fpp]
----
module M1 { constant b = 0 }
----

And here is a third one:

[source,fpp]
----
module M2 { 
  constant a = M1.a
  constant b = M1.b
}
----

Call these translation units 1, 2, and 3 for purposes of the example in
the following section.

=== Models

A *model* is a collection of one or more
<<Detailed-Description_Translation-Units-and-Programs_Translation-Units,translation
units>>. A model is presented to one or more translators for
<<Translation,translation>>.
How this is done depends on the translator. Typically, you ask a
translator to read a single translation unit from standard input and/or
to read one or more translation units stored in files, one unit per
file.

==== Example

<<Detailed-Description_Translation-Units-and-Programs_Translation-Units_Example,Translation
units 1-3 in the previous section>>, taken together, form a single
model. That model is equivalent to the following single translation
unit:

[source,fpp]
----
module M1 { constant a = 0 }
module M1 { constant b = 1 }
module M2 { 
  constant a = M1.a
  constant b = M1.b
}
----

According to the
<<Scoping-of-Names_Module-Definitions,semantics of module definitions>>,
this is also equivalent:

[source,fpp]
----
module M1 {
  constant a = 0
  constant b = 1
}
module M2 { 
  constant a = M1.a
  constant b = M1.b
}
----

Note that translation unit 3 alone is not a valid model, because it
uses free symbols defined in the other translation units. Similarly, the
translation unit 3 together with just translation unit 1 or translation
unit 2 is not a valid model.
