== Translation

*Translation* is the process of checking a source model
and generating code. It involves the following steps:

1. Lexing and parsing to generate an abstract syntax tree (AST)

2. If step (1) succeeded, semantic analysis of the AST.

3. If step (2) succeeded, code generation.

FPP is intended to support a variety of translation
strategies. For example, we need to generate (1) C++ code for FSW and 
(2) XML, Python, or other code to export to ground tools.
