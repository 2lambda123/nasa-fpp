=== Translation Units

A *translation unit* forms part of a
<<Detailed-Description_Translation-Units-and-Programs_Programs,model>>
at the top level.

==== Syntax

A translation unit is an
<<Detailed-Description_Element-Sequences,element sequence>> in which each 
element is any kind of
<<Detailed-Description_Definitions,definition>>
except an enumerated constant definition,
and the terminating punctuation is a semicolon.
Syntactically, it is identical to a
<<Detailed-Description_Definitions_Module-Definitions_Syntax,module member 
sequence>>.

==== Example

Here is a translation unit:

[source,tnet]
----
include::./Detailed-Description/src/Translation_Units_and_Programs/Translation_Units/Example_1.tnt[tag=visible]
----

And here is another one:

[source,tnet]
----
include::./Detailed-Description/src/Translation_Units_and_Programs/Translation_Units/Example_2.tnt[tag=visible]
----

And here is a third one:

[source,tnet]
----
include::./Detailed-Description/src/Translation_Units_and_Programs/Translation_Units/Example_3.tnt[tag=visible]
----

Call these translation units 1, 2, and 3 for purposes of the example in
the following section.
