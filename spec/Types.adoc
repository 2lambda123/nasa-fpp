== Types

=== Primitive Types

*Primitive types* are the types of the primitive scalar values supported
by F Prime. There are four kinds of primitive
types: unsigned integer types, signed integer types, floating-point
types, and the Boolean type.

* The unsigned integer types are `U8`, `U16`, `U32`, and `U64`. The `U`
stands for "`unsigned.`" The number after the U is the width of the
representation in bits, using the standard binary representation of an
unsigned integer.

* The unsigned integer types are `I8`, `I16`, `I32`, and `I64`. The `I`
stands for "`[signed] integer.`" The number after the I is the width of
the representation in bits, using the standard binary two's complement
representation of a signed integer.

* The floating-point types are `F32` and `F64`. These are IEEE
floating-point values of width 32 and 64 bits, respectively.

* The Boolean type is `boolean`.
This type represents the two values `true` and `false`.

The signed and unsigned integer types, collectively, are called the
*primitive integer types*.
The integer types together with the floating-point types are called the
*primitive numeric types*.

=== The Integer Type

The type _Integer_ represents all integer values, without regard
to bit width.
This type does not appear in FPP source programs.
The compiler assigns it to expressions during <<Type-Checking,type checking>>.

=== Integer and Numeric Types

The _Integer_ type together with the 
<<Types_Primitive-Types,primitive integer types>> are called
the *integer types*.
The _Integer_ type togeher with the 
<<Types_Primitive-Types,primitive numeric types>> are called
the *numeric types*.

=== The String Type

The type `string` is the type of string values.

=== Array Types

An *array type* is a
<<Scoping-of-Names_Qualified-Identifiers,qualified identifier>> that 
refers to an
<<Definitions_Array-Type-Definitions,array type definition>> via the
<<Scoping-of-Names_Resolution-of-Qualified-Identifiers,rules for name 
scoping>>. For example:

[source,fpp]
----
TODO
----

=== Enum Types

An *enum type* is a
<<Scoping-of-Names_Qualified-Identifiers,qualified
identifier>> that refers to an
<<Definitions_Enum-Definitions,enum definition>> via the
<<Scoping-of-Names_Resolution-of-Qualified-Identifiers,rules
for name scoping>>. For example:

[source,fpp]
----
module N {
  enum E { X = 0, Y = 1 }
}
constant a = N.E.X # a has type N.E
----

`N.E` is an enum type.

=== Struct Types

A *struct type* is a
<<Scoping-of-Names_Qualified-Identifiers,qualified identifier>> that 
refers to a
<<Definitions_Struct-Type-Definitions,struct type definition>> via the
<<Scoping-of-Names_Resolution-of-Qualified-Identifiers,rules for name 
scoping>>. For example:

[source,fpp]
----
TODO
----

=== Abstract Types

An *abstract type* is a
<<Scoping-of-Names_Qualified-Identifiers,qualified identifier>> that refers to 
a
<<Definitions_Abstract-Type-Definitions,abstract type 
definition>> via the
<<Scoping-of-Names_Resolution-of-Qualified-Identifiers,rules for name 
scoping>>. For example:

[source,fpp]
----
TODO
