=== Abstract Type Definitions

An *abstract type definition* associates a name with a type
without specifying the type.
In generated code, the type is specified externally (e.g., as a C++ class).

==== Syntax

`abstract` `type` <<Lexical-Elements_Identifiers,_identifier_>>

==== Semantics

The identifier is the name _N_ of the type.
The definition associates the name _N_ with an unspecified type _T'_.
The name _N_ can be used as a type elsewhere in the model.
There are no values associated with _N_ in the model.

==== Examples

[source,fpp]
----
# Defines an abstract type A
abstract type A
# Defines a struct type B whose member x has type A
struct type B {
  x : A
  y : F32
} default B { y = 1 }
