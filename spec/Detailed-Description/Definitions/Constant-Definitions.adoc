==== Constant Definitions

A *constant definition* associates a name with a compile-time constant
value. You can use the name in place of the value elsewhere in the
program.

===== Syntax

`constant`
<<Detailed-Description_Identifiers,_identifier_>>
_[_ `:`
<<Detailed-Description_Types,_type_>>
_]_ `=`
<<Detailed-Description_Expressions,_expression_>>

===== Semantics

_type_ is optional. If it is present, then
<<Type-Checking,the type of _expression_>> must be
<<Type-Checking_Type-Conversion,convertible to>> _type_.

If _type_ is present, then the type of the constant is _type_.
Otherwise, the type of the constant is the type of _expression_.

_expression_ must
<<Evaluation,evaluate>>
to a compile-time constant value _v_. At any program point where the
<<Scoping-of-Names_Qualified-Identifiers,qualified identifier>> _Q_ refers to 
the constant definition according to the
<<Scoping-of-Names-Resolution-of-Qualified-Identifiers,scoping
rules for names>>, you can use _Q_ as a name for the value that results
from
<<Evaluation,converting>> _v_ to the type of the constant.
