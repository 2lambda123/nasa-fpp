This document describes **F Prime Prime**, also known as FPP or F Double Prime.
FPP is a modeling language for the https://github.com/nasa/fprime[F Prime 
flight software framework].
A https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/smallsat/2018/all2018/328/[paper 
presented at SmallSat 2018]
provides an overview of F Prime.

The goals of FPP are as follows:

* To provide a modeling language for F Prime that is simple, easy to use, and
well-tailored to the domain.

* To provide semantic checking and error reporting for F Prime models.

* To generate code in the various formats that F Prime uses, e.g.,
C++, Python, XML.
