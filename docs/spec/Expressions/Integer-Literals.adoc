=== Integer Literals

An *integer literal expression* is one of the following:

* A sequence of decimal digits `0` through `9` denoting the decimal
representation of a nonnegative integer.

* `0x` or `0X` followed by a sequence of hexadecimal digits
`0` through `9`, `A` through `F`, or `a` through `f` denoting the hexadecimal 
representation of a nonnegative
integer.

An integer literal value stem:[v] must be representable as an unsigned
integer using most 64 bits, i.e., it must lie in the range stem:[0 <= v < 2^64].
