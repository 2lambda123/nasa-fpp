=== String Literals

A *string literal expression* is a sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes.
The characters must be printable ASCII characters, and the double
quote character itself is not allowed.

*Examples:*

* `"abc"` is a valid string representing the characters `a`, `b`, and `c`.

* `"abc` is not a valid string, because it is missing the terminating double quote.

* `"ab"c"` is the valid string `"ab"` followed by the identifier `c` and an 
unmatched double quote character.
