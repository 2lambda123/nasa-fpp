=== String Literals

A *string literal expression* is a sequence of characters enclosed in double 
quotes.
The characters must be printable ASCII characters, not including newline.
The double quote character itself is not allowed, except that the character 
sequence `\"`
represents a single double quote character.

*Examples:*

* `"abc"` is a valid string consisting of the characters `a`, `b`, and `c`.

* `"ab\""` is a valid string consisting of the characters `a`, `b`, and `"`.

* `"abc` is not a valid string, because it is missing the terminating double quote.

* `"ab"c"` is the valid string `"ab"` followed by the identifier `c` and an 
unmatched double quote character.
