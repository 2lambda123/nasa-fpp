=== State Junction

A *state junction* specifies a state junction in a  
<<Definitions_State-Machine-Definitions,state machine>>.  
A _junction_ is a type of psuedo state.  It serves as an intermediate point in a transition path allowing a transtion to branch based on the returned value of the _guard_ (predicate).  Other psuedo states in the state machine terminology are _initial_ and _final_

==== Syntax

`junction` <<Lexical-Elements_Identifiers,_identifier_>>
`{`
`if` <<Lexical-Elements_Identifiers,_identifier_>> <<State-Machine-Behavior-Elements_State-Visit,state visit>>
`else` <<State-Machine-Behavior-Elements_State-Visit,state visit>>
`}`

==== Semantics

. The _identifier_ after the keyword `junction` is the name of the _junction_. 

. Each _junction_ requires a unique name.

. The _identifier_ after the keyword `if` specifies the name of the _guard_

. The _state visit_ specifies the state to enter with an optional action

==== Examples

state machine Device {

  action initPower
  guard coldStart

  initial J1

  junction J1 {
    if coldStart visit OFF
    else visit ON do initPower
  }

  state OFF {

  state ON {
