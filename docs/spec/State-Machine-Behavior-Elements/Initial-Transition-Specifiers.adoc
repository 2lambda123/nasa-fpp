=== Initial Transition Specifiers

An *initial transition specifier* is part of a
<<Definitions_State-Machine-Definitions,state machine definition>>
or a
<<State-Machine-Behavior-Elements_State-Definitions,state definition>>.
It specifies an initial transition, i.e., a transition taken
when starting up a state machine or entering a state with
substates.

==== Syntax

`initial` 
<<Scoping-of-Names_Qualified-Identifiers,_ident_>>
_[_
`do`
<<Lexical-Elements_Identifiers,_identifier_>>
_]_

==== Semantics

. The identifier must
<<Definitions_State-Machine-Definitions_Scoping-of-Names,refer>>
to a 
<<State-Machine-Behavior-Elements_State-Definitions,state definition>>
or a
<<State-Machine-Behavior-Elements_Junction-Definitions,junction definition>>.
It specifies the initial state or junction to visit.
The state definition or junction definition referred to must be part of
the same state machine definition or state definition where the initial
transition specifier appears.

. If present, the optional identifier after the keyword `do`
must
<<Definitions_State-Machine-Definitions_Scoping-of-Names,refer>>
to an 
<<State-Machine-Behavior-Elements_Action-Definitions,action definition>>.
It specifies the action to perform when visiting the state or junction.

==== Examples

----
state machine Device {

  action initDevices

  # When the state machine starts up, visit the ON state
  initial ON

  state ON {

    # When entering the ON state, visit the POWERING_UP substate
    initial POWERING_UP do initDevices

    state POWERING_UP

  }
