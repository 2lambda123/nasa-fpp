=== State Event Definitions

A *state event definition* defines an event that may be dispatched
to a state machine.
Dispatched events are placed on a first-in first-out (FIFO) queue.
When the state machine processes events, it runs to completion.
This means that it means that there are no events in the queue,
and no state transitions are immediately required.

==== Syntax
`event`
<<Lexical-Elements_Identifiers,_identifier_>>
_[_
`:` 
<<Type-Names,_type-name_>>
_]_

==== Semantics

. The identifier specifies the event name.

. If present, the optional type name specifies the type of the
data carried by the event.
If _type-name_ is not present, then the event carries no data.

==== Examples

----
struct FaultData {
  id: U32
  data: U32
}

# An event without data
event RTI

# An event with data
event Fault: FaultData
