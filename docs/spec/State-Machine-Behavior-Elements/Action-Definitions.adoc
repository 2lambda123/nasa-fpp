=== Action Definitions

An *action definition* defines an action, i.e., a function that is called when
a state machine performs a state transition.
Actions may carry data.

==== Syntax
`action`
<<Lexical-Elements_Identifiers,_identifier_>>
_[_
`:` 
<<Type-Names,_type-name_>>
_]_

==== Semantics

. The identifier specifies the name of the action.

. If present, the optional type name specifies the type _T_ associated
with the action.
A value of type _T_ will be passed into the function associated with
the action when it is called.
If _type-name_ is not present, then there is no data associated with the 
action.

==== Examples

[source,fpp]
----
struct FaultData {
  $id: U32
  data: U32
}

@ A state machine with action definitions
state machine ActionDefs {

  @ An action without data
  action initPower

  @ An action with data
  action reportFault: FaultData

  ...

}
