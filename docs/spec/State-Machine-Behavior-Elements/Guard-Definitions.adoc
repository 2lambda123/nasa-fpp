=== Guard Definitions

A *guard definition* defines a guard, i.e., a
function that returns a Boolean value.
Guards are associated with transitions.
If a transition has a guard, then the transition occurs
if and only if the guard evaluates to `true`.

==== Syntax
`guard`
<<Lexical-Elements_Identifiers,_identifier_>>
_[_
`:` 
<<Type-Names,_type-name_>>
_]_

==== Semantics

. The identifier specifies the name of the guard.

. If present, the optional type name specifies the type _T_ associated
with the guard.
A value of type _T_ will be passed into the guard function when it is called.
If _type-name_ is not present, then there is no data associated with the 
guard.

==== Examples

----
struct FaultData {
  $id: U32
  data: U32
}

@ A state machine with guard definitions
state machine GuardDefs {

  @ A guard without data
  guard noRecovery

  @ A guard with data
  guard noRecovery: FaultData

  ...

}
