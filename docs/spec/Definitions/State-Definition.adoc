=== State Definition

A *state definition* specifies a state in a 
<<Definitions_State-Machine-Definitions,state machine>>  

==== Syntax

* `state` <<Lexical-Elements_Identifiers,_identifier_>>
_[_ `{` _state_sequence_ `}` _]_

_state-sequence_ is an 
<<Element-Sequences,element sequence>> in
which each element is a *state member*,
and the terminating punctuation is a semicolon.
A state member is one of the following

* A <<Definitions_State-Initial,state initial>>
* A <<Definitions_State-Definition,state definition>>
* A <<Definitions_State-Junction,state junction>>
* A <<Definitions_State-Entry,state entry>>
* A <<Definitions_State-Exit,state exit>>
* A <<Definitions_State-Internal,state internal>>
* A <<Definitions_State-Transition,state transition>>


==== Semantics

. The _identifier_ specifies the name of a state in the state machine

. The state can be hierarchical, a state can be defined within another state

. Each hierarchical state is expected to contain one _state initial_, all other elements are optional
