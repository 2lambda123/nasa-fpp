=== State Junction

A *state junction* specifies a state junction in a  
<<Definitions_State-Machine-Definitions,state machine>>  

==== Syntax

* `state` <<Lexical-Elements_Identifiers,_identifier_>>
`<choice>`

==== Semantics

. The _identifier_ is the name of the junction.  Junction states are simple and have no hierarchy and no entry or exit functions.

. Each junction requires a unique name.

. Each Junction requires two exit transitions in which one must have one guard and the other transition no guard.

    c1 -> Black: [NotReady()]
    c1 -> Green: /startAction()
}
