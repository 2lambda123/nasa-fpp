=== State Guards

*state guards* specifies _guards_ that are associated with transitions.  A _guard_ is a predicate or function that returns a boolean.  Guards are placed on transitions.  When a guard evaluates to True the transition is taken, else the transition is not taken.

==== Syntax
`guard`
<<Lexical-Elements_Identifiers,_identifier_>>
_[_
`:` 
<<Type-Names,_type-name_>>
`]`

==== Semantics
. The _identifier_ specifies the guard name wich is a function that returns a boolean.  When the guard is evaluated to True, it allows the transition to be invoked.

. The _type-name_ specifies an optional data type associated with the guard and will be
passed into the guard function when invoked.

==== Examples
