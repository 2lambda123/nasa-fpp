=== State Guards

*state guards* specifies _guards_ that are associated with transitions

==== Syntax
`guard`
<<Lexical-Elements_Identifiers,_identifier_>>
_[_
`:` 
<<Definitions_Struct-Definitions,struct definition>>
`]`

==== Semantics
. The _identifier_ specifies the guard name wich is a function that returns a boolean.  When the guard is evaluated to True, it allows the transition to be invoked.

. The _struct definition_ specifies an optional data structure associated with the guard and will be
passed into the guard function when invoked.

==== Examples

----
struct FaultData {
    id: U32
    data: U32
}

# A guard without data
guard noRecovery

# A guard with data
guard noRecovery: FaultData
