=== State Events

*state events* specifies _events_ that are dispatched to the state machine which causes the state machine to run to completion.
When a state machine _runs to completion_ it means that it processes all pending events and transitions through its states until it reaches a stable state where no further transitions are immediately required.

==== Syntax
`event`
<<Lexical-Elements_Identifiers,_identifier_>>
_[_
`:` 
<<Type-Names,_type-name_>>
`]`

==== Semantics
. The _identifier_ specifies the event name.

. If present, the optional _type-name_ names the type of the data carried by the event.  If _type-name_ is not present, then the event carries no data

==== Examples

[source,fpp]
----
struct FaultData {
    id: U32
    data: U32
}

# An event without data
event RTI

# An event with data
event Fault: FaultData
