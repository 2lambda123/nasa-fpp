=== State Events

A *state events* specifies an event, guard and action used in transitions. 

==== Syntax
* <<Lexical-Elements_Identifiers,_identifier_>>
_[_ 
`[`
<<Lexical-Elements_Identifiers,_identifier_>>
`()`
`]`
_]_
_[_
`/`
<<State-Machine-Behavior_State-Functions,_state-functions_>>
_]_

==== Semantics
. The first _identifier_ specifies the event that triggers the transition.

. The second _identifier_ specifies the guard that determines if the transition is taken.

. The _state-functions_ specifies the list of actions taken if the transition is taken

==== Examples

[source,fpp]
----
state machine MonitorSm {
    state Black
    state Green
    state Yellow
    
    # A transition triggered by an event
    Black -> Green : Ev1

    # A transition triggered by an event with actions
    Black -> Green : Ev1/action1(); action2();

    # A transition triggered by an event with a guard
    Black -> Green : Ev1[guard()]

    # A transition triggered by an event with a guard and actions
    Black -> Green : Ev1[guard()]/action1(); action2()

}

=== State Definition

A *state definition* specifies a state in a 
<<Definitions_State-Machine-Definitions,state machine>>  

==== Syntax

* `state` <<Lexical-Elements_Identifiers,_identifier_>>
_[_ `{` _state_sequence_ `}` _]_

_state-sequence_ is an 
<<Element-Sequences,element sequence>> in
which each element is a *state member*,
and the terminating punctuation is a semicolon.
A state member is one of the following

* A <<State-Machine-Behavior_State-Initial,state initial>>
* A <<State-Machine-Behavior_State-Definition,state definition>>
* A <<State-Machine-Behavior_State-Junction,state junction>>
* A <<State-Machine-Behavior_State-Entry,state entry>>
* A <<State-Machine-Behavior_State-Exit,state exit>>
* A <<State-Machine-Behavior_State-Internal,state internal>>
* A <<State-Machine-Behavior_State-Transition,state transition>>


==== Semantics

. The _identifier_ specifies the name of a state in the state machine

. The state can be hierarchical, a state can be defined within another state

. Each hierarchical state is expected to contain one _state initial_, all other elements are optional

. Each state must have a unique name

==== Examples

[source,fpp]
----
state machine MonitorSm {

    # state initial
    [*] -> Black

    # hierarchical state definition.  Black has sub states Idle and Running 
    state Black {
        # state initial
        [*] -> Idle

        state Idle
        state Running

        # state transition
        Idle -> Running: RTI
    }

    # state definition
    state Green

    # state junction
    state c1 <choice>

    # state transitions
    Black -> c1: RTI
    c1 -> Black: [guard()]
    c1 -> Green

}

=== State Functions

*state functions* specifies a list of functions separated by a semicolon.  

==== Syntax
<<Lexical-Elements_Identifiers,_identifier_>>
`()`

==== Semantics

. The identifier is a state machine function

==== Examples

[source,fpp]
----
state machine MonitorSm {
    state Black {
        entry: action1(); action2()
    }

}

----

=== State Initial

A *state initial* specifies an initial state transition  

==== Syntax

* `[*]` -> 
<<Lexical-Elements_Identifiers,_identifier_>>


==== Semantics

. The identifier specifies the initial state transition. 

==== Examples

[source,fpp]
----
state machine MonitorSm {
    [*] -> Black
}

----

=== State Internal

A *state internal* specifies an internal transition in a 
<<State-Machine-Behavior_State-Definition,state>>    

==== Syntax

* `internal`
`:`
<<State-Machine-Behavior_State-Events,_state_events_>>

==== Semantics
. An `internal` transition occurs within a <<State-Machine-Behavior_State-Definition,state>> and does not cause a transition to another state

. The _state_events_ specifies the event, guard and actions for the internal transition

==== Examples

[source,fpp]
----
state machine MonitorSm {

    state Black {
        # state internal
        internal: Ev1[guard()]/action()
    }

}

----

=== State Junction

A *state junction* specifies a state junction in a  
<<Definitions_State-Machine-Definitions,state machine>>  

==== Syntax

* `state` <<Lexical-Elements_Identifiers,_identifier_>>
`<choice>`

==== Semantics

. The _identifier_ is the name of the junction.  Junction states are simple and have no hierarchy and no entry or exit functions.

. Each junction requires a unique name.

. Each Junction requires two exit transitions in which one must have one guard and the other transition no guard.

==== Examples

[source,fpp]
----
state machine MonitorSm {

    # state junction
    state c1 <choice>

    state Black {
        Entry: StartMonitor()
    }

    state Green
    
    Black -> c1: StartEvent
    c1 -> Black: [NotReady()]
    c1 -> Green: /startAction()
}

----

=== State Transition

A *state transition* specifies a state transition in a   
<<Definitions_State-Machine-Definitions,state machine>>    

==== Syntax

* <<Lexical-Elements_Identifiers,_identifier_>> 
`->`
<<Lexical-Elements_Identifiers,_identifier_>> 
`:`
<<State-Machine-Behavior_State-Events,_state-events_>>

==== Semantics
. The first _identifier_ specifies the initial state

. The second _identifier_ specifies the target state

. The _state-events_ specify the event, guard and actions for the transition

==== Examples

[source,fpp]
----
state machine MonitorSm {
    # state transition
    Black -> Green: ValidSignal[guard()]/action()

}
