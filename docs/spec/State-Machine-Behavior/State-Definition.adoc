=== State Definition

A *state definition* specifies a state in a 
<<Definitions_State-Machine-Definitions,state machine>>  

==== Syntax

* `state` <<Lexical-Elements_Identifiers,_identifier_>>
_[_ `{` _state_sequence_ `}` _]_

_state-sequence_ is an 
<<Element-Sequences,element sequence>> in
which each element is a *state member*,
and the terminating punctuation is a semicolon.
A state member is one of the following

* A <<State-Machine-Behavior_State-Initial,state initial>>
* A <<State-Machine-Behavior_State-Definition,state definition>>
* A <<State-Machine-Behavior_State-Junction,state junction>>
* A <<State-Machine-Behavior_State-Entry,state entry>>
* A <<State-Machine-Behavior_State-Exit,state exit>>
* A <<State-Machine-Behavior_State-Internal,state internal>>
* A <<State-Machine-Behavior_State-Transition,state transition>>


==== Semantics

. The _identifier_ specifies the name of a state in the state machine

. The state can be hierarchical, a state can be defined within another state

. Each hierarchical state is expected to contain one _state initial_, all other elements are optional

. Each state must have a unique name

==== Examples

----
state machine MonitorSm {

    # state initial
    [*] -> Black

    # hierarchical state definition.  Black has sub states Idle and Running 
    state Black {
        # state initial
        [*] -> Idle

        state Idle
        state Running

        # state transition
        Idle -> Running: RTI
    }

    # state definition
    state Green

    # state junction
    state c1 <choice>

    # state transitions
    Black -> c1: RTI
    c1 -> Black: [guard()]
    c1 -> Green

}
