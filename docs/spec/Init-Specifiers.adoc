== Init Specifiers

An *init specifier* associates some initialization
code with a 
<<Definitions_Component-Instance-Definitions,
component instance>>.

=== Syntax

`init` <<Scoping-of-Names_Qualified-Identifiers,_qual-ident_>>
`phase` <<Expressions,_expression_>>
<<Lexical-Elements_Code-Strings,_code-string_>>

=== Semantics

* The qualified identifer must 
<<Scoping-of-Names_Resolution-of-Qualified-Identifiers,refer to>>
a
<<Definitions_Component-Instance-Definitions,
component instance definition _D_>>.

* The expression following the keyword `phase` must have
a <<Types_Internal-Types_Numeric-Types,numeric type>>.
It provides an integer identifier for an initialization phase.

* The code string specifies some code in a target language
that is associated with the instance.

The meaning of the initialization phase and the code depends
on the translation context.

=== Example

[source,fpp]
----
@ Phases of initialization
enum Phases {
  @ When components are constructed
  CONSTRUCTION
  @ After components are constructed, and before connections are established
  BEFORE_CONNECTIONS
  @ After connections are established
  AFTER_CONNECTIONS
}

init commandDispatcher phase CONSTRUCTION
"""
Svc::CommandDispatcher cmdDisp("commandDispatcher");
"""

init commandDispatcher phase BEFORE_CONNECTIONS
"""
commandDispatcher.init(QueueDepth::commandDispatcher);
"""
