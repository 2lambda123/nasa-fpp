=== Unused Port Specifiers

An *unused port specifier* specifies that one or more ports in a
<<Definitions_Topology-Definitions,topology definition>>
may be unused.

==== Syntax

`unused` `{` _unused-port-sequence_ `}`

_unused-port-sequence_ is an
<<Element-Sequences,element sequence>> in 
which each element is a
<<Scoping-of-Names_Qualified-Identifiers,qualified identifier>>,
and the terminating punctuation is a comma.

<<Scoping-of-Names_Qualified-Identifiers,_qual-ident_>>

==== Semantics

For each qualified identifier _Q_ appearing in 
_unused-port-sequence_:

. _Q_ must have the form _Q'_ `.` _P_, where _Q'_ is a 
qualified identifier, and _P_ is an identifier.

. _Q_ must
<<Scoping-of-Names_Resolution-of-Qualified-Identifiers,refer to>>
a component instance _I_ that is available in the enclosing topology,
either through
<<Specifiers_Component-Instance-Specifiers,direct specification>>
or through
<<Specifiers_Topology-Import-Specifiers,import>>.

. _I_ must refer to a <<Definitions_Component-Instance-Definitions,component 
instance definition _I'_>>.

. _I'_ must refer to a <<Definitions_Component-Definitions,component 
definition _C_>>. 

. The identifier _P_
must refer to a
<<Specifiers_Port-Instance-Specifiers,port instance specifier>>
of _C_.
