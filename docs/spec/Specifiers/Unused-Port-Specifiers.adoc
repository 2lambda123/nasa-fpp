=== Unused Port Specifiers

An *unused port specifier* specifies that one or more ports in a
<<Definitions_Topology-Definitions,topology definition>>
may be unused.

==== Syntax

A connection graph specifier is one of the following:

`unused` `{` _unused-port-sequence_ `}`

_unused-port-sequence_ is an
<<Element-Sequences,element sequence>> in 
which each element is an *unused port*,
and the terminating punctuation is a comma.
An unused port is the following:

<<Scoping-of-Names_Qualified-Identifiers,_qual-ident_>> `.`
<<Lexical-Elements_Identifiers,_identifier_>>

==== Semantics

For each unused port _U_:

. The qualified identifier _Q_ appearing in _U_ must
<<Scoping-of-Names_Resolution-of-Qualified-Identifiers,refer to>>
a component instance _I_ that is available in the enclosing topology,
either through
<<Specifiers_Component-Instance-Specifiers,direct specification>>
or through
<<Specifiers_Topology-Import-Specifiers,import>>.

. _I_ must refer to a <<Definitions_Component-Instance-Definitions,component 
instance definition _I'_>>.

. _I'_ must refer to a <<Definitions_Component-Definitions,component 
definition _C'_>>. 

. The identifier following _Q_
must refer to a
<<Specifiers_Port-Instance-Specifiers,port instance specifier _P_>>
of _C'_.
