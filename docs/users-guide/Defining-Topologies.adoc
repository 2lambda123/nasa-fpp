== Defining Topologies

In F Prime, a *topology* is the highest level of software architecture
in a FSW application.
A topology specifies the
<<Defining-Component-Instances,component instances>>
used in the application and how their
<<Defining-Components_Port-Instances,port instances>>
are connected.

An F Prime FSW application consists of a topology plus a small amount
of top-level {cpp} code that you write by hand.
In the section on
<<Analyzing-and-Translating-Models_Implementing-Deployments,
implementing deployments>>, we will explain more about the top-level
{cpp} code.
In this section we explain how to use FPP to define a topology.
