== Installing FPP

Before reading the rest of this document, you should install
the latest version of FPP.
The installation instructions are available here:

https://github.jpl.nasa.gov/bocchino/fpp/tree/master/compiler#compiler

Make sure that the FPP tools are in your shell path.
For example, running `fpp-check` should succeed and should
prompt for standard input. (You can type control-C to end
the program.)
