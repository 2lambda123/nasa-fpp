== Defining Ports

A *port definition* defines an F Prime port.
In F Prime, a port specifies the endpoint of a connection
between two component instances.
Components are the basic units of FSW function in F Prime
and are described in the
<<Defining-Components,next section>>.
A port definition specifies (1) the name of the port, (2) the type of the data 
carried
on the port, and (3) an optional return type.

=== Port Names

The simplest port definition consists of the keyword `port` followed
by a name.
For example:

[source,fpp]
----
port P
----

This code defines a port named `P` that carries no data and returns
no data.
This kind of port can be useful for sending or receiving a triggering event.

=== Formal Parameters

More often, a port will carry data.
To specify the data, you write *formal parameters*
enclosed in parentheses.
The formal parameters of a port definition are similar to the formal parameters 
of a function in a programming
language: each one has a name and a type, and you may write
zero or more of them.
For example:

[source,fpp]
----
port P1() # Zero parameters; equivalent to port P1
port P2(a: U32) # One parameter
port P3(a: I32, b: F32, c: string) # Three parameters
----

The type of a formal parameter may be any valid type, including an
array type, a struct type, an enum type, or an abstract type.
For example, here is some code that defines an enum type `E` and
and abstract type `T`, and then uses those types in the
formal parameters of a port:

[source,fpp]
----
enum E { A, B }
type T
port P(e: E, t: T)
----

Each formal parameter of a port _P_ becomes bound to an argument (a value) when 
_P_ is *invoked*.
The invocation occurs in {cpp} code that implements the model.
To invoke a port, you call an auto-generated function.
The arguments are {cpp} values, and their types must match the
types of the {cpp} function parameters generated from the FPP port parameters.
The invocation may be *synchronous* (via a direct function call)
or *asynchronous* (via a message queue);
we will discuss these cases further below in the section on
<<Defining-Components,defining components>>.

The formal parameters form an
<<Defining-Constants_Multiple-Definitions-and-Element-Sequences,element
sequence>> in which the optional terminating punctuation is a comma.  As usual
for element sequences, you can omit the comma and use a newline instead.  So,
for example, we can write the definition shown above in this alternate way:

[source,fpp]
----
enum E { A, B }
type T
port P(
  e: E
  t: T
)
----

=== Ref Parameters

You may write the keyword `ref` in front of any formal parameter _p_.
Doing this specifies that _p_ is a *reference parameter*, i.e.,
its data is passed by reference when the passing happens in a
synchronous port invocation.
For example:

[source,fpp]
----
type T
port P(ref a: T)
----

In this example, `a` is a reference parameter of type `T`.
In a synchronous context, `a` is passed by reference.
In an asynchronous context, it is passed by value, because
it is serialized onto a queue.

There are at least two reasons to use a `ref` parameter:

. To avoid copying a large data value when sending
it in a synchronous port invocation.
For example, if `T` is an image with a large physical
size, then marking the parameter `a` `ref` saves 
copying the image when performing a synchronous invocation 
on the port `P`.

. To return a value to the sender by storing it through
the reference.
We discuss this case in the next section on returning
values.

*XML limitation:* In the current version of the F Prime XML-to-{cpp}
autocoder, if a parameter `a` of a port `P` passes a large value, 
you should generally mark `a` `ref` in all cases, for performance
reasons:

. If `P` is used in a synchronous context, then passing `a` by reference
will save a copy, as discussed above.

. If `P` is used in an asynchronous context, then 
the `ref` marking will allow the generated code to avoid some 
unnecessary copies.

In a future version of the autocoder, we intend to eliminate the
unnecessary copies in case (2).

=== Returning Values

Optionally, you can give the port a return type.
To do this you write an arrow `pass:[->]` and a type
after the name and the formal parameters, if any.
For example:

[source,fpp]
----
type T
port P1 -> U32 # No parameters, returns U32
port P2(a: U32, b: F32) -> T # Two parameters, returns T
----

Invoking a port with a return type is like calling a function with
a return value.
Such a port may be used only in a synchronous context (i.e.,
as a direct function call, not as a message placed
on a concurrent queue).

In a synchronous context only, `ref` parameters provide another way to return 
values on the port,
by assigning to the reference, instead of executing a {cpp} `return` statement.
As an example, consider the following two port definitions:

[source,fpp]
----
type T
port P1 -> T
port P2(ref t: T)
----

The similarities and differences are as follows:

. Both `P1` and `P2` must be used in a synchronous context,
because each returns a `T` value.

. In the generated {cpp} code,

.. The function for invoking `P1`
has no arguments and returns a `T` value.
A handler associated with `P1` returns a value of type `T`
via the {cpp} `return` statement.
For example:
+
----
T P1_handler() {
  ...
  return T(1, 2, 3);
}
----

.. The function for invoking `P1` has one argument `t`
of type `T&`.
A handler associated with `P2` returns a value of type `T`
by updating the reference `t` (assigning to it, or updating
its fields).
For example:
+
----
void P2_handler(T& t) {
  ...
  t = T(1, 2, 3);
}
----
+
+

The second way may involve less copying of data.

Finally, there can be any number of reference parameters,
but at most one return value.
So if you need to return multiple values on a port, then reference
parameters can be useful.
As an example, the following port attempts to update a result
value of type `U32`.
It does this via reference parameter.
It also returns a status value indicating whether the update
was successful.

[source,fpp]
----
enum Status { SUCCEED, FAIL }
port P(ref result: U32) -> Status
----

A handler for `P` might look like this:

----
Status P_handler(U32& result) {
  Status status = Status::FAIL;
  if (...) {
    ...
    result = ...
    status = Status::SUCCEED; 
  }
  return status;
}
----

=== Annotating a Port Definition

A port definition is an
<<Writing-Comments-and-Annotations_Annotations,annotatable element>>.
Each formal parameter is also an annotatable element.
Here is an example:

[source,fpp]
----
@ Pre annotation for port P
port P(
  @ Pre annotation for parameter a
  a: U32
  @ Pre annotation for parameter b
  b: F32
)
----
