== Defining Modules

In an FPP model, a *module* is a group of model elements that are all qualified
with a name, called the *module name*.
An FPP module corresponds to a namespace in {cpp} and a module in Python.

To define a module, you write the keyword `module` followed by one
or more definitions enclosed in curly braces.
For example:

[source,fpp]
----
module M {
  constant a = 1
}
----

The module name qualifies the names of the definitions it encloses.
To write the qualified name, you write the qualifier, a dot, 
and the base name: for example `M.a`. (This is also the way that
name qualification works in Python, Java, and Scala.)
Inside the module, you can use the qualified name or the unqualified
name.
Outside the module, you must use the qualified name.
For example:

[source,fpp]
--------
module M {
  constant a = 1
  constant b = a # OK: refers to M.a
  constant c = M.b
}

constant a = M.a
constant c = b # Error: b is not in scope here
